# GameChooser
A Site that chooses which video game I should play when I can't decide for myselfðŸ•¹

A simple Javascript (jQuery) application that randomly chooses a game for me to play when I am bored and can't decide for myself, out of the (very small) selection of PS4 games I own. 

Thinking of adding more functionality (...and more games...), such as being able to enter YOUR own games and use this decision maker for more than just me!
